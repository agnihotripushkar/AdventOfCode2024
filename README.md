# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by year, with source code located in the `src` directory and input/test data in the root directories.

### Source Code (`src/org/devpush/com/`)

- **2023** (`aoc2023`): Solutions written in **Kotlin**.
- **2024** (`aoc2024`): Solutions written in **Java**.
- **2025** (`aoc2025`): Solutions written in **Kotlin**.

### Input and Test Data

The input and test files are located in the following directories at the project root:

- `aoc2023/`
- `aoc2024/`
- `aoc2025/`

Each year directory contains subdirectories for inputs and tests (e.g., `input_a`, `input_b`, `test_a`, `test_b`).

## Usage

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Navigate to the specific day's solution in the `src` directory.
3. Run the `main` method or the respective runnable file for the day.
